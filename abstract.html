        <p>The dragon is a mysterious and formidable creature widely known by people. Three dragons appearing in Game of Throne and A Song of Ice and Fire are people's favorite. For a long time, we people do not even know whether the dragon exists. Through our model, we can analyze the requirements for the dragon's living detaily.</p>
<p>To determine the growth of the dragon, we suppose the dragon is geometrical similar as time goes by. We use Richards equation to simulate, which presents a clear 'S' curve varying with time. This curve could be divided into three parts, iincluding initial growth stage, exponential growth stage and steady growth stage. The turning points to divide these three stages are at the age of 19 and 131. The fastest growing speed occurs when the dragon is 52 years old.</p>
<p>To calculate the energy expenditure for the dragon, we suppose that the dragon will not fly and breathe fire unless predating. First we yield the conversion efficiency of the dragon's preies that net energy takes over 57% of the whole absorbing energy. Second, we divide the net energy into five parts, which are: the energy for basic metabolish, the energy for growth, the energy for flight, the energy for breathing fire and energy for recovery of trauma. These five parts are derived by the chemical formula of dragon's respiration, the derivative of 'S' trend curve, the emprical formula between speed consuming minimum power and the dragon's weight, the SFM model of the heating transferation and the coefficient describing the posibility of trauma. Since the energy of flying and breathing fire are coupling with the total energy expenditure by the flying distance and the number of preies, we develop an algorithm to calculate the total energy expenditure. This energy also presents a 'S' curve as time goes by. Finally, we answer the question of 'how much area is required to the three dragons', we use the method solving 'Cattle grazing problem' for reference.</p>
<p>After that, we build a model analyzing the manifestation of the dragon under different climate condition. The total energy expenditure and the distribution of the preies will both be affected by this factor. For the aspect of the total energy expenditure, the temperature declining causing by the climate changes will increase the energy of breathing fire and for basic metabolish, which is in accrodance with our life experience. For the aspect of the preies distribution, we use the density of sheep and cattle in Australia, and the result shows that ... .</p>
<p>At last, our model analyze the interaction between the dragon and environment. We divide the ecosystem into three layers: the predators, the preies and the environment. Through ... method, we determine the impact between first two layers. By using the maximum entropy method, we set forth the interaction between last two layers.</p>
<p>Sensitivity analysis shows that ...</p>
